This backend system supports secure file sharing with encryption using RSA and AES-GCM. The following features and components have been fully implemented:

### üîê **Authentication & Authorization**
- JWT-based user authentication with middleware to protect sensitive routes.
- Middleware to decode tokens and authorize user access.

### üì¶ **Secure File Upload**
- Files are encrypted on upload using AES-256 in GCM mode (ensuring confidentiality and integrity).
- AES key is generated per file and encrypted using the receiver‚Äôs RSA public key.
- Encrypted file data and AES key are stored in MongoDB.

### üì• **Secure File Download**
- Receiver can decrypt the file using their RSA private key (protected with a password).
- File content is decrypted using AES-GCM with authentication tag verification.

### üîë **Key Management**
- RSA key pair (2048-bit) is generated for each user.
- Public key is stored in plain PEM format.
- Private key is stored encrypted using the user's password.

### üìÑ **File Metadata Handling**
- File metadata (name, type, sender, receiver, etc.) is stored and retrievable.
- Option to mark files as downloaded (for auditing purposes).

### üìÇ **User File Management**
- API to fetch all files sent or received by the logged-in user.
- Relationship mapping between users and shared files using Mongoose references.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Encryption Utilities**
- Utility functions built for AES-GCM encryption/decryption.
- Utility for encrypting and decrypting AES keys using RSA.
- Node-forge used for robust cryptographic operations.
